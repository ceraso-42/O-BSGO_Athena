###### No code will be available until a stable release is finished.
###### This repo has little to none code from BigPoint. Although you are required to have the original game files in order to run the server, since the server uses the game's dll for essential run code.

## About
This is a BSGO server emulator of a Massive Multiplayer Online game known as Battlestar Galactica Online that was created by BigPoint. It's an emulation of the original server, that tries to bring back the original essence of the game. It is written in C# (.NET Core 6.0) and uses SQLite to save the player data. It still is in its initial stages so bugs and missing protocols are expected when using it.
