## About
This is a BSGO server emulator of a Massive Multiplayer Online game known as Battlestar Galactica Online that was created by BigPoint. It's an emulation of the original server, that tries to bring back the original essence of the game. It is written in C# (.NET Core 6.0) and uses SQLite to save the player data. It still is in its initial stages so bugs and missing protocols are expected when using it.

## Features
- Supported version:
  - Latest released by BigPoint. I'm not sure if it works for other versions.

## Credits
- aeroson (For the implementation of UnityEngine.Quaternion).
- bubisnew.
- Mementomori (aka FLOREK BGO).
