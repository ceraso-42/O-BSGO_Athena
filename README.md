###### Bytestream is awaiting initial true commit from <a href="https://github.com/victti/OpenBSGO" target="_blank">this</a> parent repository. Until then, we wait. Development from <a href="https://github.com/victti/BSGO-Private-Server" target="_blank">predecessor</a> to Open BSGO may begin in earnest.
###### Message from upstream: No code will be available until a stable release is finished.
###### To retain legitimacy, any clients capable of connecting to this server that contain licensed content from NBC Universal must be sourced by the user pending a licensing agreement. This server aims to be compatible with the Battlestar Galactica Online client simply to allow people that already have obtained the game, to continue playing an Abandonware game.
